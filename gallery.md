## Overview
We are curating web archived content by the SUCHO volunteers in Omeka, an open-source content management system. The gallery is visible at [Exploring Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online](https://gallery.sucho.org). This task includes identifying web archived objects, curating metadata, and reviewing created item records.

## Receive admin access to the Omeka gallery
If you don't have admin access to the gallery, join the #gallery channel in Slack and request an account. Once an account is created you will receive a confirmation email instructing you to create a passcode and log in. (Check your junk or spam folder if you don't see it in your inbox). You'll then be able to log in at [https://gallery.sucho.org/admin/](https://gallery.sucho.org/admin/).

## Log in
If you've already signed-up, you can log in with existing credentials. You can also request a password reset if needed. When you are logged in you will see a dashboard displaying the number of items and other statistics. Click on the 'Items' tab in the left sidebar to view all of the item records in Omeka.

## Selecting an object to curate
View the [SUCHO Gallery Suggestions spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tn830D2kJ__ihWYbrRsZr15Y3LU0pDUXyE2qdiepPSk/edit?usp=sharing) from which you can select objects that have not been added to Omeka.

* Select an object in the spreadsheet that no one has claimed yet. To claim an object, on that row of the spreadsheet, add you name to the 'Item added to gallery by' column.' Go to the instructions to 'Create an Item Record' below.

  * Coming soon: If you would like to identify an object from an archived website that is not yet on this list, go to the [insert spreadsheet info](insert link) to find a web site with objects that you would like to include in the gallery.
    * Select a specific object from an archived website and enter in the information based on the column headings.
    * For example: if you select the '[Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater](http://www.donetsk-region-theater.in.ua)' as the archived website you would then identify a single object from that website to include in the gallery, such as a [19th c. photograph of the theater](http://www.donetsk-region-theater.in.ua/storya_teatru_).

## Create an Item Record
1. Go to [https://gallery.sucho.org/admin/](https://gallery.sucho.org/admin/)
2. Create a new item. From the dashboard, select the 'Add a new item' button at the bottom.
   * This will open the creation menu, automatically displaying the Dublin Core fields.
   * A more detailed version of these instructions is available with screenshots in [the Item Creation Guide document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6mxiLusK3X_antCuUAScOoax3gN5Xa3ccyHN_DNQGQ/edit?usp=sharing).
3. **Title**: enter the original title of the work in Ukrainian then add a second input with an English translation in brackets.
4. **Creator**: always include names in their original language first, with transliterated names in the second entry. Use this transliteration tool to create the transliterations; do not do so by hand and do not use Google Translate. The format should always be “Last Name, First Name Patronymic.” (Include the patronymic if known.)
5. **Date**: should represent its creation or publication. It should be represented in ISO format (YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD) and in a human readable format (YYYY Month DD). If you can't find or do not know the date, enter unknown in brackets.
6. **Description**: create 2-3 sentences in length in English and include an original description if present.
7. **Publication**: if the item has publication information known, include it in the Publisher field with the formatting: Place of Publication: Publisher. This painting was, of course, not published, but a published monograph might look something like: Oxford: Oxford University Press.
8. **Subject**: include = subject headings in original language when possible. Enter each one in a separate entry. Include all original subject headings. Add English subject headings that describe the intellectual content and format of the item. Enter each one in a separate entry. Include no more than four English subject headings. Capitalize the first word in all subject headings.
9. **Language**: only indicate a language when there is text or sound present in the item itself. This painting does not include any language, therefore it will be left blank even though the website from which the image was taken is in Ukrainian.
10. **Identifier**: URLs should be included for both the source page and for a SUCHO-archived copy when possible. Indicate the source URL as 'Original source:' followed by a hyperlink and 'Archived copy: followed by a hyperlink. Select the 'Use HTML' checkbox to hyperlink the URL using the WYSIWYG editor.
    * If there is a local identifier used by the host institution present on the webpage, include this in another input. Describe it as 'Exhibit registration number:' or 'Object identifier:' or in whatever way represents the verbiage used by the host institution to define what that local identifier is.
12. **Contributor**: Add your name to the contributor field to indicate that you created the record. This information will not be shown on the front-end.
13. Select the **Item Type Metadata** tab: Select 'SUCHO' from the drop-down 'Item Type' list.
    * **Host institution**: input the host institution's name in the original language first and a transliteration or officially used English name second. (In the case that an organization uses an official English name, e.g. Київський Зоопарк uses the official English name of 'Kyiv Zoo,' include this instead of a transliteration.)
    * **Institution location**: Indicate the location of the host institution.
    * **Institution type**: select an option from the drop down menu. If an appropriate type is not in the list, suggest a new type in the “Proposed Institution Type entries” tab of the SUCHO Gallery Suggestions spreadsheet.
14. Select the **Files** tab and choose a file
    * Select the appropriate file from your computer and click 'Open.' This will then show the file name displayed beside the 'Choose File' option.
15. On the right of the screen, use the drop-down under 'Collection' to assign the item to the 'Web Archived Objects' collection.
16. Select 'Add Item' to save your item. It will not yet be made public until the administrators review and publish it.
17. Go back to the [SUCHO Gallery Suggestions spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tn830D2kJ__ihWYbrRsZr15Y3LU0pDUXyE2qdiepPSk/edit?usp=sharing) and the number of the item you created in the 'Omeka Item No.' column and type 'Y' in the 'Added to Gallery?' column.


## Reviewing Item records
* Find an item that has not yet been reviewed in the [SUCHO Gallery Suggestions spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tn830D2kJ__ihWYbrRsZr15Y3LU0pDUXyE2qdiepPSk/edit?usp=sharing).
* Claim it by adding your name in the 'Reviewed by (person)' column and type 'Underway' in the 'Review completed?' column
* Locate the item in Omeka and check the metadata in all of the 'Item Record' fields as well as the 'Item Type Metadata' and 'Files' tabs.
* Refer to the more detailed [Item Creation Guide document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6mxiLusK3X_antCuUAScOoax3gN5Xa3ccyHN_DNQGQ/edit?usp=sharing) if you have questions or post them in the #gallery channel in Slack.
  * Follow the identifier URL or the web archived copy URL to verify that the object appears on the website.
  * If there is metadata or a description of the object on the website use it to cross-check the item record metadata.
* When you complete the review, type 'Y' in the 'Review completed?' column. If there are issues, leave a note in the 'Notes' column and type 'Problem.'

<p>SUCHO is an initiative of over 1,500 international volunteers who are collaborating online to digitize and preserve Ukrainian cultural heritage. Since the start of the invasion, SUCHO has web-archived more than 5,000 websites and 50TB of data of Ukrainian cultural institutions, to prevent these websites from going offline. The websites range from national archives to local museums, from 3D tours of churches to childrenâ€™s art centers.</p>

<p>We have <a href="/equipment">donated digitization equipment</a> to over 70 cultural heritage institutions, and are now <a href="https://opencollective.com/sucho/projects/equipment">raising funds for additional kits</a>.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://gallery.sucho.org/">gallery of Ukrainian cultural heritage</a> curates a selection of images from the web archives we have created, as well as newly-digitized materials.</p>

<p>We are also <a href="https://memes.sucho.org/">archiving memes from the war</a> as a richly-annotated (and transcribed/annotated) data set for current and future historians and other scholars.</p>

# I'm new here, how do I help?

Welcome, and thank you for volunteering! It's been amazing to see so many people come together to help archive Ukrainian cultural heritage sites.

If you haven't filled out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform), that's the place to start. We go through the responses to that form a couple times a day and send people a link to our Slack, where we're organizing everything.

## Once you're in Slack

We're posting relevant information for newcomers in the *#orientation* channel, including things like times for upcoming Zoom sessions. You can drop by anytime in the Zoom session window to chat with an organizer who can help you get started, or troubleshoot tasks that you're working on. Head to that channel first once you join Slack.

### How we've organized Slack

We've organized our Slack channels around the technologies people are using to capture sites, which corresponds roughly to tabs in our working spreadsheet:

* *#browsertrix* is for people who are relatively tech-comfortable, and involves running the WebCrawler Browsertrix Docker container. If that doesn't resonate with you, we have many other options!
* *#internetarchive* is for people who can help curate the "SUCHO‚Äù collection on the Internet Archive: [https://archive.org/details/sucho](https://archive.org/details/sucho)
* *#manualwebrecorder* is for people using the [Fast ArchiveWeb interface](https://fast.archiveweb.page/#https://example.com/) or [WebRecorder browser plugin](https://www.sucho.org/webrecorder-plugin-instructions) to manually create web archives by navigating sites (especially complex sites w/ lots of javascript or human interaction). If you can browse a website, you can handle these tasks!
* *#waybackmachine* is for people submitting links (including large sets of links) to the Internet Archive for archiving. We're doing this particularly for Ukrainian journals and other scholarship. You can do this manually or try to automate it with code from the #scraping channel.
* *#scraping* is for people writing their own custom scrapers using code, often as a way to speed up tasks in the *#waybackmachine* channel. But we're also using it for URLs to send to the *#browsertrix* group
* *#translation* is full of people who can read Russian and/or Ukrainian. If you're confused about how to navigate a site you're working on, or what something means, head over there and ask.
* *#linkcollection* is for people working on finding new links to add to our workflow by submitting them via the [URL form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform)
* *#qualitycontrol* is for people who can more or less read Ukrainian and/or Russian, to check on the web archives we've created and make sure they're actually complete.
* *#metadata* is for people who are curating metadata for items uploaded into the Internet Archive. 
 
## Choosing tasks

Based on the descriptions of the Slack channels above, you may want to pick a particular channel / type of task to focus on, depending on your technical and language skills. *#waybackmachine* probably has the clearest and most straightforward set of things to do that don't need any linguistic or technical knowledge, but if you're comfortable enough browsing websites and clicking on links in a language you don't understand, there's also tasks in *#manualwebrecorder* that don't need any technical expertise.

The SUCHO working spreadsheet (linked in Slack) has all tasks, along with links to detailed instructions (or notes with less detailed instructions) for each of them. If you have any questions about it, please ask in the corresponding channel on Slack (e.g. ask about Internet Archive tasks in #waybackmachine), or check with an organizer (start with Quinn Dombrowski & Anna Kijas).

If you'd like to have someone who's online help you find a task and get started, post in the *#mentors* channel and we can try to match you with a mentor.

If there's an archive that seems to be getting too big and you're running out of space, ping Seb on Slack and let him know.

### Finding a task

SUCHO is organized through a massive Google Sheet. Different tasks and activities are arranged in different tabs (indicated in the image below). First find the tab that corresponds to the kind of task you want to do (keep scrolling with the arrows in the bottom right -- there's more than one screen of tabs!), then click on it to make it your current active tab.

### Claiming a task
Put your name down in the "claimed by" column when you decide to work on a task. (If you can't edit the sheet, send a permission request and Quinn will try to respond promptly.) Change the status to "in progress". We try to break up most tasks into "bite-sized pieces" so people can do just a little. If you have a larger amount of time available to work on this, feel free to claim multiple tasks. If you don't get to them, you can remove your name and change the status back to "volunteer needed".

### Working on a task
If you've got questions while working on a task, try asking in the corresponding channel (e.g. #manualwebrecorder for tasks in the Manual WebRecorder tab of the sheet).

### Completing a task
If you're not sure what to do with the data when you're done with the task, and there aren't more specific directions in the instructions for the task, check out our [guide to data upload](/data-upload). Be sure to mark the task as done in the sheet when it's completed, and fill in any info needed there (e.g. links to the spreadsheets you created full of Internet Archive links)

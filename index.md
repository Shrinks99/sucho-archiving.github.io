# Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO)

Since its launch on March 1, 2022, Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) has brought together over 1,300 volunteers to create high-fidelity web archives of around 4,500 Ukrainian cultural heritage websites, amassing over 52 TB of data. These websites range from national archives to local museums, from 3D tours of churches to children’s art centers. We have identified these websites in many ways: crowdsourcing, examining DNS records for all websites registered in the Ukrainian namespace or with Ukrainian contact info, and manually walking through Google Maps for cities under attack, looking for the museum icon. We've used both the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), the [Browsertrix crawler](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) to create these archives. As we find fewer and fewer new websites to archive, SUCHO is moving into a new phase of the project with three goals: **Curate, Donate, Educate**.

## Donating
We're currently raising funds for digitization equipment to send to Ukrainian libraries, archives, and museums that have requested it. [Donate to the Ukrainian digitization equipment fund here](https://opencollective.com/sucho/projects/equipment).

# How can I help?


## Volunteering 
Since May, we've been at capacity for volunteers, but we'll be adding everyone from the standby list to the project by the end of July 2022. We're currently working on a new set of tasks as part of our *Phase 2: Curate, Donate, Educate*. If you're interested in volunteering, please [fill out our volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform) and we'll be in touch by the end of the month. 

We'll need help looking for memes (in many languages) for our [meme wall collection](http://memes.sucho.org/), selecting objects for the [gallery](https://gallery.sucho.org/), and doing quality control and curating our web archives.

How we've organized things (last updated March 15th).

## Sending links to SUCHO

You don't have to fill out the volunteer form to help SUCHO archive Ukrainian cultural heritage websites! Anyone [can submit a link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform) via our webform, and volunteers will make sure it's not a duplicate, and then send it into our archiving workflow.


## Acquiring and capturing links

- Most links get submitted via the [Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online webform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform)
- Submitted links are world-viewable [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rf0sQ3OB7tirk1xKiaa52lzV9ZTCDkx7eiuK5EXj6l8/edit#gid=336731417)
- A couple times a day, admins go through that spreadsheet and copy new submissions into the Browsertrix tab of the SUCHO working sheet (linked in Slack), after de-duping to the extent possible. [Browsertrix (WebRecorder running in a Docker container)](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) is our first pass for the sites that get submitted, and we move things to other tools if it turns out they don't work well with Browsertrix.
  - We're not currently capturing Ukraine-related sites that are hosted outside of Ukraine
- Volunteers pick a task from any of the sheets, claim it by putting their name down and changing the status to "in progress", and either follow specific instructions in the spreadsheet (like for [Ukrainian National Library journals](/nbuv-journals)), or general instructions (like [using the WebRecorder browser plugin](webrecorder-plugin-instructions))
- When volunteers are done, they mark it as complete and fill in any info needed in the spreadsheet (e.g. links to Internet Archive bulk-capture spreadsheets)
- A couple times a day, admins go through the SUCHO work spreadsheet and move things that are done into the Done tab of the SUCHO working sheet
- Once a day, admins update the [world-viewable link submission sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rf0sQ3OB7tirk1xKiaa52lzV9ZTCDkx7eiuK5EXj6l8/edit#gid=336731417) with the status of things people have submitted

## Volunteering

- Volunteers fill out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform)
- A couple times a day, admins add new submissions from the volunteer form to the SUCHO Slack and the SUCHO work spreadsheet
- Admins welcome new members and check in with them about the kind of work they'd like to help with, directing them to the right Slack channel
- We have daily open orientation hours to help with getting started and troubleshooting; info goes in the #orientation channel (also cross-posted on #general)

## Finding new links

There are multiple (probably at least partially-overlapping) web archiving efforts related to the invasion of Ukraine. SUCHO is focused on cultural heritage. Volunteers are welcome to look for additional links we should be capturing, and can use our list-of-lists, the [Guides to cultural heritage](https://www.sucho.org/cultural-heritage) page, as a starting point. For volunteers who can't read Ukrainian or Russian, the [Google Translate browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb/RK%3D2/RS%3DBBFW_pnWkPY0xPMYsAZI5xOgQEE-) can help give a sense of many sites. If it doesn't work, just move on to another site. Once you find a link, submit it through the [link submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform)

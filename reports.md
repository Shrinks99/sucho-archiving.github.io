## March - December 2022
Access to the full report for March - December 2022 will be available soon.

Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online launched on March 1, 2022 and brought together 1500+ volunteers from more than 38 countries who are collaborating online to preserve Ukrainian digital cultural heritage. During Phase 1 of the initiative, we saved over 51 TB of data from 5,400+ websites of Ukrainian cultural heritage institutions. In Phase 2, we began coordinating aid shipments of digitization hardware, identifying resources for training Ukrainian cultural workers in digitization methods, curating Ukrainian culture in an online exhibit, and archiving Ukrainian war memes. During this period, we have served as a digitally-oriented partner for UNESCO, IFLA, and the Ukrainian Library Association in their discussions about developing a National Digital Library of Ukraine.

## Travel notes

SFO is the closest airport to fly into, though it's feasible to go via OAK as well. Hotels are mind-blowingly expensive throughout the area, especially around Palo Alto. If feasible, a shared Airbnb with other guests is more affordable, though it may lead to reimbursement challenges from universities. There's public transit of varying quality that can get you throughout the region and between the different events; we'll likely be traveling around together that way.

In partnership with the Centre for Digital History in Rivne, SUCHO is launching the "Memory Savers" internship project beginning June 1, 2023. Twenty Ukrainian students will be paired with museums in Ukraine to support digital preservation of their collections. Participating students will develop their own projects as part of their internships, they will report about their work on a project blog, and they will participate in three coordination meetings in Ukraine which will givde them an opportunity to meet local experts and discuss their ideas with them. Students will also present their projects at an event in Ukraine that will occur in December.

This program will enable the students to gain invaluable first-hand experience in museum work. SUCHO will support the participating museums with the necessary equipment, advise them on data storage, and connect them with experts. The project is funded by the [German Foundation EVZ](https://www.stiftung-evz.de/en/) (Remembrance, Responsibility, Future).

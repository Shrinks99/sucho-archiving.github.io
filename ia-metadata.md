# Overview
We have uploaded a collection of objects to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/sucho) through manual and bulk upload processes. These objects have minimal and sometimes inaccurate metadata so we need to review and correct metadata which will be appended to the records in this collection.

If you would like to help with the process of correcting or adding metadata to SUCHO records, please do the following:
* Join the #metadata channel in the SUCHO Slack workspace
* Familiarize yourself with the [metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtMHY8ZxJQbmS9KNXrz4oIrfoaHk6GdLjSlNkkfS77k/edit#gid=0)
* Review the 'Instructions for filling out the metadata spreadsheet' below
* Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqRjacS5Awk) for an intro to filling out the metadata
* You can always ask questions or get folks to review your first few rows by simply asking in Slack

# Instructions for filling out the metadata spreadsheet
## What am I looking at?
The [metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtMHY8ZxJQbmS9KNXrz4oIrfoaHk6GdLjSlNkkfS77k/edit#gid=0) is a list of all items that were added to the SUCHO collection in the Internet Archive before we had a clearly laid out metadata template. The headings of this spreadsheet indicate the metadata we would ideally like for each SUCHO item. While we realize that filling in each cell will not always be possible, the columns that are mandatory for IA are indicated with an * in the header.
* We are working on metadata in the Tab titled **Current Work**
* Here is a [longer version of the instructions for filling out the metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpax1HQmWOVXqbA9NTCU4WBZNWKfLPhUTqxs7s94Jas/edit?usp=sharing)

## Please follow these steps:
1. Add your name/initials to a selection of rows you’d like to work on in **Column B** claimed by and use the **Column A Status** dropdown to indicate they are **In Progress**

2. Click on the URL in **Column D identifier** and open the link. Examine the item. It may be helpful to look at the links after 'scraped from' and 'linked from' in **Column O description** to gain additional context and information about the item. These links are also found in the description on the IA page for the item.
    * If the item is a web page only (in other words, there is no photo, PDF, text file, etc.) set the status as 'Needs Help' in **Column A Status** and comment in **Column M comments** 'This is a web page.'
    * If you notice in the 'description' column that the domains in the 'data rescue copy' and 'scraped from' do not match, flag it as 'Needs Help' and leave a comment about this.
       * For example these are two different domains: Data rescue copy of https://**archives.gov.ua**/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2016_3289.jpg scraped from https://**cdiak.archives.gov.ua**/full_files/

3. Determine, as best you can, what the proper name of the resource should be (in its original language wherever possible) and edit the data in **Column C title**.

4. For items that do not have a link pointing back to the original item at the host institution - check the (insert link to updated main SUCHO spreadsheet) in the 'done' tab to see if you can find the collection this came from and go back to the item record.
      * **Image Prioritization**: Often there are images that are logos from webpages or advertisements. Use your best judgment here: these are not part of the goal of saving Cultural Heritage Collections. If you do not feel that your time is best spent locating information about these, simply mark them as **Low Priority** in the **Column A Status** and leave the rest of the metadata as is. **Note**: Institutional logos are NOT **low priority images** (the web designers’ generic stamps are). See these examples:
          * [Not low priority image](https://cdiak.archives.gov.ua/images/logo_p.png)
          * [Low priority image](https://lib.kherson.ua/files/lib/Image/vex/development-space/gallery/1-2-6iQ.png)
      * When images are scraped from a website, it is useful to indicate if the image is a **thumbnail** (a smaller version of a full digital image). If describing a thumbnail, please add [thumbnail] after the title. Here is an example of a thumbnail vs. the full image:
          * [Thumbnail](https://archive.pinchukartcentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Savadov_Artwork_2002_Suputnyk_oil_canvas_210x150.jpg-300x225.jpg) [on this page](https://archive.pinchukartcentre.org/artists/arsen-savadov)
          * [Full image](https://archive.pinchukartcentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Savadov_Artwork_2002_Suputnyk_oil_canvas_210x150.jpg.jpg) of the same work [on this page](https://archive.pinchukartcentre.org/works/arsen-savadok-suputnik-2002-polotno-oliya)
      * If you are unsure where to locate information about the images, see our [FAQ section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpax1HQmWOVXqbA9NTCU4WBZNWKfLPhUTqxs7s94Jas/edit#heading=h.81330kcris8v)

5. If you have questions or confusion over the Ukrainian text, please use the Status dropdown to mark the row as **Translation** and ping the folks in the #translation channel in Slack.

6. Wherever possible, fill in **Columns F to O**, using the details in the [metadata template](insert link). Please keep the following in mind:
      * Subject headings should be selected from Column A in the [Subject Headings List tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtMHY8ZxJQbmS9KNXrz4oIrfoaHk6GdLjSlNkkfS77k/edit#gid=140170532). If you need a term that isn’t currently available there, please see our [FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpax1HQmWOVXqbA9NTCU4WBZNWKfLPhUTqxs7s94Jas/edit#heading=h.81330kcris8v) for details on how to add one.
      * If the item has subject headings (SH) in Ukrainian, please add or move that to **Column F original_subject_heading**.
      * If the item has a description in Ukrainian, please add or move that to **Column N original_description**.
      * **Host Institution (Column K)**: please use the transliterated version of the institution’s name (eg. Khersons′ka oblasna universal′na naukova biblioteka imeni Olesi͡a Honchara).
        * For transliterating, see the [FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpax1HQmWOVXqbA9NTCU4WBZNWKfLPhUTqxs7s94Jas/edit#heading=h.81330kcris8v) below.
      * **Host institution** and **creator** are not the same thing. Host institution is a required field and usually the owner of the website is the host institution (e. g. the library, the archive, the theater, etc.) The creator is the creator of the actual item (the photographer, the author, the painter, etc.)
      * **Host location (Column L)** should be at the city level. See instructions above in the metadata template for details on how to fill out this column.

7. If you can’t figure out the metadata for any item, or you have questions about what has already been entered into IA, change the **Column A Status** dropdown to **Needs Help**, and add some comments in **Column M comments**. Someone will come along and try to help/answer questions :)

8. Once the entire row is complete, change the **Status** to **Done**.

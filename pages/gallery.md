## SUCHO gallery of Ukrainian cultural heritage

<img src="/assets/images/gallery-screenshot.jpg" style="float:right;">

The purpose of the [SUCHO Gallery, “Exploring Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online”](https://gallery.sucho.org), is three-fold:

* Raise awareness of Ukrainian cultural heritage by featuring objects from institutional websites archived by the SUCHO project

* [Raise funding](/donate) for digitization equipment needed by Ukrainian institutions.

* Provide Ukrainian educational institutions and community groups both inside and outside Ukraine with materials that could be used for teaching and learning about Ukraine that may be otherwise unavailable.

* In collaboration with Ukrainian cultural institutions, this gallery will provide the worldwide public with context for, and a glimpse of, the history, intellectual life and culture of Ukraine, by displaying a representative variety of important cultural touchpoints.

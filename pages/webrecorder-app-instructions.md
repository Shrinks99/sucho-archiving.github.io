Thank you for volunteering to capture Ukrainian cultural heritage sites using the ArchiveWeb.page desktop app! Hereâ€™s a guide for using it.

## Setup
Download and install the [right version of the ArchiveWeb.page for your computer](https://webrecorder.net/archivewebpage/) (.exe for Windows, .dmg for Mac, .zip for Linux).

## Claiming a site
On the SUCHO spreadsheet (linked in Slack), go to the Webrecorder plugin tab
- Add your name in the "Claimed by" column for the site you want to record
- Read any notes or comments on the site you want to record

## Site review
Visit the site before you start recording it. Click around to get a sense of what's there and how it works. Some sites have complex audio or video elements. When you're just checking out the site on your own, it may help to use something like the [Google Translate browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb/RK%3D2/RS%3DBBFW_pnWkPY0xPMYsAZI5xOgQEE-) to understand what's going on, but be sure to disable it when you actually do the web recording so it doesn't machine-translate everything as you go

## Setting up the site recording
When you're ready to record, launch the ArchiveWeb.page app. (On Macs, you may need to say that you do really want to open the software.)

Click the *+ Create New...* button at the top of the page. Use the title of the website from the spreadsheet as the name of the archive.

## Recording the site
For the archive you've just created, you should see a table where one of the columns is labeled "Actions". Click on the blue circle icon under "Actions" to start the recording. 

A window will pop up with a field for the URL you want to start with. In almost all cases, you should check the "Start with Autopilot" button, which will automatically scroll down the page to capture everything. Paste the URL into the box, and hit the "Go!" button.

This will launch a web browser window within ArchiveWeb.page. You can see the status of the web recording in the upper right corner of that window by clicking on the ArchiveWeb.page icon.

Each time a new page loads, you'll see a number on top of that icon. That represents the number of objects that are currently being archived. Once you see a green square (instead of a yellow square with a number), you can keep navigating the site by clicking on one of the links on the page. The auto-pilot scroll down and capture things until you see the green square above the ArchiveWeb.page icon in the upper right once again.

Work through the pages of the site, one by one, until you've captured everything. If you're not able to capture everything, make note of which section(s) of the site you've captured so someone else can work on the rest.


## Downloading the web archive file
When you're done, hit the "Download" icon (the one with the arrow pointing down) under *Actions* in the ArchiveWeb.page app. Save the .WACZ file to your computer.

## Uploading the web archive file
Go to the [WACZ upload form](https://forms.gle/N18MxWgoHtPB2xpz8). Enter the metadata and upload the WACZ file that you just downloaded.

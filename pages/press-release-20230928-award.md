The winners of the European Heritage Awards / Europa Nostra Awards 2023, Europe’s top honour in the field, were celebrated this evening with a high-level event held at the iconic Palazzo del Cinema at the Lido in Venice. This year’s European Heritage Awards Ceremony was held in the presence of Cecilia Bartoli, the world-renowned mezzo-soprano who is the President of Europa Nostra. Margaritis Schinas, European Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, addressed the audience of some 700 people live from Brussels. Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, congratulated the winners through a video message. The ceremony was the largest event of the European Cultural Heritage Summit 2023, which is taking place on 27-30 September in the World Heritage City of Venice. The ceremony was jointly organised by Europa Nostra and the European Commission in partnership with the City of Venice.

During the ceremony, the five laureates of the Grand Prix and the winner of the Public Choice Award were announced. These top winners were selected from among this year’s 28 award-winning heritage achievements from 20 European countries by the Board of Europa Nostra on recommendation by an independent jury of experts.

Cecilia Bartoli, President of Europa Nostra, stated: _“What a joy for me to be in Venice for this evening of celebration of the winners of the European Heritage Awards / Europa Nostra Awards 2023. Every year, our award winners bring hope and inspiration to us all. The variety in terms of content and geographical range of their projects, their scope and individual nature perfectly reflect the richness and diversity of our culture. And the people who devote their hearts and energy to these projects are compelling ambassadors of how to safeguard, restore and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage. My heartfelt congratulations to all the winners, particularly to the laureates of the Grand Prix and the winner of the Public Choice Award”._

This large network of international volunteers, mobilised by a group of leading heritage professionals, rapidly reacted to the threats to heritage generated by Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and began their work in the first days of the war. Using existing digital tools, these volunteers have helped ensure that a huge amount of Ukrainian heritage assets could be safeguarded. They have also made significant efforts to digitise at-risk collections.

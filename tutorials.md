# Tutorials

These tutorials will help volunteers get started with different kinds of tasks.

## Orientation
* [I'm new here, how do I help?](/orientation)

## Tools

* Check where a site is hosted with [https://hostingchecker.com/](https://hostingchecker.com/)

**Browsertrix**
What we need most right now is people to help us run Browsertrix for full-site archiving. The [Browsertrix documentation](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) is quite good as these kinds of tools go, but we'e also written a [intermediate-tech person's guide to Browsertrix](browsertrix). Ideally you'll have come across the command line and maybe used it once or twice before trying our tutorial, but you don't need to be a coder or particularly "technical".

* [Guide to using Browsertrix Cloud (easy, web-based)](/browsertrix-cloud)
* [Guide to installing and using Browsertrix (for intermediate-tech volunteers)](/browsertrix)
* [Browsertrix on a Raspberry Pi](/raspberry-pi)

**Internet Archive tasks**

* Using the [Internet Archive Google Sheets link submission tool](/ia-gsheets)
* Programmatically [bulk uploading to the Internet Archive](/ia-bulk-upload)
* [Working with Internet Archive metadata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-REbP8lhh0) (YouTube video)

**Manual WebRecorder tasks**
The easiest and fastest option is the brand-new [ArchiveWeb.page Express](https://fast.archiveweb.page/#https://example.com/), which is literally just a website you go to, put in a URL, and start creating a web archive as you scroll through pages and navigate the site. You can even hit a "Crawl links" button and it will automatically visit each link on the page and scroll to the bottom to capture everything, which is especially great if you don't read Ukrainian or Russian! Try this first; just click the "Download Archive" button when you're done, and [upload the resulting file as described here](/data-upload).

* Using the [WebRecorder browser plugin](/webrecorder-plugin-instructions)
* Using the [ArchiveWebPage app](/archivewebpage-app-instructions) (an alternative to the browser plugin)

**Situation monitoring**
We also need people to help track the latest alerts for different areas of Ukraine.

* [Situation monitoring guide](/situation-monitoring)


## Data
* [Where do I put the data?](/data-upload)
* If you have WACZ files that are too large to upload via the Google form, follow [these instructions](/wacz-upload-aws)

## Quality control
* [Quality control for captured archives (for Ukrainian & Russian speakers)](/qc)

## Hacks
* [Useful Hacks](https://www.sucho.org/hacks)
  * Automate URL list based on a filename pattern

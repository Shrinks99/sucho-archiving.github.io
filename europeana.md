Europeana has a large number of digitized heritage objects, but only stores metadata and thumbnails. We want to try to track down the original sources for materials from Ukraine.

Here's the [list of Europeana materials from Ukraine](https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&qf=COUNTRY%3A%22Ukraine%22). Each object has an image and a small amount of metadata, including its source.

For each item with a unique source, click on the item image to go to its page. Under the *Good to know* tab, you'll see *Providing institution*. Click on the link to that institution and add that URL to our the link collecting sheet in the SUCHO working sheet (linked in Slack).

For links that don't go to institutional sites (some of them seem to not work), [add a task to the "Other" tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kGScdU9df7T2QS9RnM_qvciT04Y1tmBiGVH-XD1E4l0/edit#gid=342786496) in our working spreadsheet for someone to go try to find the webpage of the institution online.
